Greetings, this is Taimin CHen and thank you for taking time view my coding demo.

For a quick overview:
1. Demo1 is trying to replicating an innovated online experiment(A/B test in most cases) algorithm from a KDD paper. This paper is trying to use statistical techniques to improve the power of t-test and furtherly increase the predict accuracy in future user's action. Here I coded with fictional self-generated simulated data to replicate the whole process and replicate the model conclusion as well.
Highlights: Online Experiment, GBDT model, Data simulation, Statistical test

2. Demo2 shows how I do text-based statistical research. This is a ongoing business research project so the confidential information is totally erased. The target of this demo is to how many "Target words(in txt format)" are in the "Candidate reports(in pdf format)". The simple code transfer .pdf and .text into .csv dataset which is able for further data analysis and statistical model implementation.
Highlights: Text-research, OCR(Optical Character Recognition), Regular Expression, Data Wrangling

3. Demo3 is a database app which is running on Virtual Machine on Google Cloud Platform. Here we code from scratch to create a personal database, connect it to online server and make it a dynamic front-end frontpage. One can search, delete, modify, add and even do condtional research on the webpage. The webpage also provides a machine-learning based recommenation algorihtm.
Highlights: Database Management, Cloud platform, SQL, Webpage building, Machine learning, User interface

4. Demo4 is a web crawler app, where I collected insurance data from open source Swiss Re database. The data in the webpage is stored in json format, and the demo use virtual agent and loop to automatically collect data. The data are stored into csv format for further statistical research.
Highlights: Web crawler, json, url, Regular expression, Data wrangling
